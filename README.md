## Swamp Mindmap Outline

**THE GREAT SWAMP** 
Visualizing “An ASPECT (tbd)” of the Great Swamp as a metaphor for examining climate change and the health of our environment. Is this a question that can be answered?  Will this be of interest to biologists, conservationists, or just people who are culturally curious?

## Form - 1st 'Swamp' Prototype

![](images/Sketch1.jpg)
**Process/Thinking**

A timeline format would scroll right... various forms of data... 2-3 graphs, animation, links to film clips and 'swamp' music, storytelling visual about the fight vs. the jetport.  Another iteration is needed once I have more concrete datasets. 

**Possible Audiences** 
- Fish & Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy, Ecologists, Environmentalists, Biologists, Neighboring NJ Communities

**Possible Takeaway** 
- How Nature and Popular Culture intersect? Make learning fun and entertaining?


## Swamp Prototypes

**Context**

In 1959 with the introduction of the first generation of commercial Jet airliners, the New York Port Authority announced plans to construct a giant 10,000 acre ‘Jetport’ 26 miles west of New York city in a semi-rural area known as the Great Swamp.

In the name of progress, entire small towns would be demolished, and the ecosystem and wildlife would be destroyed.  It seems that swamps are continually viewed as wasteland, and valuable real estate to pave over in the name of commerce and progress.


## The Big Idea

Show that swamps are a magical place, however are misunderstood and misused.  Can I influence the misperception of swamps and wetlands that exist all around us in the tri-state area? My goal is to show how, through the story of the Great Swamp, the dynamic struggle  to save some of our most misunderstood but valuable of ecosystems.

## Now Simplified! Big Idea

I created a 'Hero page' that would be the main visualization for this Thesis project.  I scrapped the 'scrollytelling' concept and simplified the graphics to a designed and interactive barchart that would be a repository for the data as well as the stories.  Created a Psuedo code (which is still in progress)
